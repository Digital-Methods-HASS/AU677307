This repository is my portfolio from my BA, History at Aarhus University, course "Digtial Methods". 

The files in the folder "Homework" is my homework from the course and part of the portfolio assigment. The other files on this front page of my repository are part of my final examn project.
I used a third file that was too large to upload. Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nTB-18aTQv8hheGkqLqzFmV3rtIulXalldw9KN4wLQs/edit?usp=sharing

The csv-files, my metadata, was downloaded from the "tategallery/collection" GitHub: https://github.com/tategallery/collection, who has kindly made their data public by dedicating it to the CC0 1.0 Universal, Public Domain Dedication.
