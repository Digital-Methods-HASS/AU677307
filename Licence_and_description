Repository discription 
This repository is my portfolio from my BA, History at Aarhus University, course "Digtial Methods". The files named "Tate", "operationealHistory_openRefine", and the three csv-files are part of my final examn project exploring gender and nationality in the Tate Gallery Collection. I used a third file that was too large to upload. Here is the link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nTB-18aTQv8hheGkqLqzFmV3rtIulXalldw9KN4wLQs/edit?usp=sharing
The csv-files, my metadata, was downloaded from the "tategallery/collection" GitHub: https://github.com/tategallery/collection, who has kindly made their data public by dedicating it to the CC0 1.0 Universal, Public Domain Dedication. 
The "EuropeanHomicide", "GOT", and "W46_ScreenDump .png"-files are a selection of my homework from the course.
